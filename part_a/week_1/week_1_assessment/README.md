# Homework 1: Convert a C program  to C++

The program should take C arrays in the "My Submission" tab and convert them to vectors. The conversion should take stdio.h definitions and functions and replace them with iostream I/O. Use C++ style comments and replace macros and #define constants with inline functions and const declarations if appropriate.

Follow the style guidelines in the text, proper indention, one-line per statement, good choice of identifiers will figure prominently in grading.

Peer grading standards will be based on documentation, good style, correctness, and elegance.

Peer Grading

After submitting your work, you will get the opportunity to grade the work of three of your peers on a scale of 0-10. The grade is a sum of several categories and you should offer a brief remark on each category in the 'Overall evaluation/feedback' section. Your own work will also be assessed by your peers, from which we'll get your grade. Since you've worked hard on your submission and would like your peers to do a good job of assessing your work, please take your time and do a good job of assessing your peers' work in return.

Using the forums

Your fellow students are a great resource, and we encourage you to sharpen your ideas against them in the forums. There is a dedicated forum for Programming Homeworks, in which you can post your questions and receive feedback before or after submitting for this assignment. Additionally, make sure to pay attention to weekly posts from the Instructor or TAs, which are intended to spur conversation on topics related to the week's topic.

Honor Code

Please remember that you have agreed to the Honor Code, and your submission should be entirely yours.

Style Guidelines

The following are very thoughtful guidelines recommended by Community TA Mike Roberts and endorsed by the rest of the staff. Keep in mind many IDE’s and programs such as gnu “indent” do some of this automatically.

Everyone gets a few (2 for HW1, 5 for all others) style misstep freebies (typos happen) so do not markdown unless they are consistently inconsistent. Be lenient not rigid. Do comment on style issues you see when you grade them.

Indenting - Must be consistent. Choice of indent size and whether tabs or spaces is used is up to the coder. One exception is that they may or may not like to indent the cases of a switch() and this is OK.

Brace placement - Must be consistent across constructs, i.e. if they do opening brace on same line as a for() they should do the same style for all loops. Functions, classes, structs should use a consistent brace placement, but maybe different from the style used for executable statements.

Comments - Files should have a file header comment (using either /* */ or // is fine). Functions should have a function comment (using either /* */ or // is fine). Other commenting is at the discretion of the coder. If you think they've done too little, too much, or have unclear comments do not dock them points, but do note that in the comment section when you grade them.

Naming - Must be consistent in style, but there are many different named entities and people will be using different styles for different types of entities so be lenient unless they are clearly using two different styles for the same type of entity, i.e. member variables - mX and y aren't consistent, local variables - localVariable and my_counter aren't consistent.

Among useful classics on programming elegantly is the “Taligent’s Guide To Designing Programs” Taligent Press 1994 ISBN 0-201-40888-0. On page 30 they say:” Use comments” Comments aren’t a replacement for reading the code; source code should be as readable as possible. … If source code isn’t completely obvious, include a comment.”

The Google C++ style guide says this:

“Comments

Though a pain to write, comments are absolutely vital to keeping our code readable. The following rules describe what you should comment and where. But remember: while comments are very important, the best code is self-documenting. Giving sensible names to types and variables is much better than using obscure names that you must then explain through comments.

When writing your comments, write for your audience: the next contributor who will need to understand your code. Be generous — the next one may be you!”
